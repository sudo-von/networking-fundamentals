#### What is a network?

The goal of the network is to move information from one device to another.
For this to work the sender and the receiver must understand each other, they need to speat the same language.
In the network speaking the same leanguage means that devices agree on how data is sent, received, organized and handled.
Basically they agree on a process that they all follow.
This is called a protocol, a lot of different protocols are used depending on what's needed at the time.

Software and hardware are designed with these protocols in mind, you will hear of protocols like ethernet and TCP which are used for sending and receiving data, you may also hear of protocols like HTTP which is used for accessing the web and SMTP which is used for email.

Usually several protocols are used together to achieve a task.

##### Notes
* In summary networks are used to connect devices together.
* Devices use the network to communicate and share information.
* To share information they must speak the same language.
* This language is called a protocol.
* A SOHO network is small, an enterprise network may be large.
* A LAN is a network in a local area.
* A WAN connects networks that are separated.
