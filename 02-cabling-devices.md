#### Cabling devices

* Cables may be copper or fibre.
* The ethernet protocol describes physical links, and how data is formatted.
* UTP is the most common copper cable. 
* UTP uses pairs of wires, twisted together. Some are for sending, others are for receiving.
* Straight-through UTP connects a host to a switch.
* Crossover UTP connects hosts to each other.
* Auto MDI-X detects the cable type, and adapts if needed.
* Full duplex devices send and receive at the same time. 
* Half duplex takes turns sending and receiving.
* Dual core fibre is full duplex, single core is half duplex.
* Use MMF fir a cheap sorther run, and SMF for longer expensive runs.
* If cables are too restrictive, consider a wireless network.
